Robot talks and moves

TODO:
Find an appropriate voice for Panoramix (Morgan Freeman) and one for the LLM mode
Create a LLM mode and a way to switch between modes (manual)
When the user is silent wait for the user to ask the question
Make sure Panoramix always gives the advice at the end of tghe conversation
The bot/user (maybe) should have a way to finish conversations
should the language be in PT or EN?
Connect with the Robots movements and screen
Somehow combine the LLMs response with movement and the screen
