TODO:
Find an appropriate voice for Asterix and one for the LLM mode (Default google tts)
Create a LLM mode and a way to switch between modes (manual)
When the user is silent wait for the user to ask the question
The bot/user (maybe) should have a way to finish conversations
should the language be in PT or EN? :our choice (keep it simple)
Connect with the Robots movements and screen
Somehow combine the LLMs response with movement and the screen
