We are passing through a vast and beautiful forest, the silence broken
only by the twittering of birds... so begins the film of The Twelve
Tasks of Asterix. And so begins this book (minus the birdsong!). The
year is 50 BC and Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans . . . entirely?
No! Somewhere in Armorica, one small village of indomitable Gauls is
still holding out against the invaders...

AND NOW
FOR THE STORY
OF THE FILM.

--- Page 2 ---
Here we have a family group, showing
the inhabitants of that little village
which dared to resist the Romans. The
gentleman perched on the shield is the
formidable Vitalstatistix, undisputed
chief of the village. His wife answers to
the name of Impedimenta (Pedimenta
for short), and formidable though
Vitalstatistix may be, she has an irri-
tating way of borrowing his shield and
his shield-bearers when she wants to

go shopping. To the extreme right,
you can see the bard Cacofonix. There
is some difference of opinion among
the bard’s contemporaries as to his
musical gifts; perhaps he Is just a little
in advance of his time.

On his left stands his chief critic, the
village blacksmith, Fulliautomatix,
whose subtle method of expressing
disapproval is to hammer Cacofonix
into the ground. The little dog in front

of the group is Dogmatix, the village
mascot, and a great friend of Obelix,
the menhir delivery-man. To be
perfectly honest, we have to admit
there are only two really sensible
people in the village: Getafix, the
druid with the long white beard, and
the famous warrior Asterix. In fact it
is thanks to these two, and Getafix’s
magic potion, that the Gaulish village
has managed to hold out against the
Romans up till now,


--- Page 3 ---
This magic potion gives to anyone -+
who drinks it superhuman strength
... fora limited period. From time to
time Getafix prescribes it for his fel-
low villagers, all except Obelix, who
fell into the cauldron as a baby, and
the potion had a permanent effect on
him, Poor Obelix is furious at being
left out, since he hates to miss the
chance of tasting anything that smells
as good as the magic potion.

And now the introductions are
over...and here comes a column
of Roman legionaries advancing
towards the village. Even the least
observant among you may notice that
the attackers do not seem exactly
eager for the fray...

--- Page 4 ---
Below, we have a scene typical of
Armorica at this period, Obelix,
delighted at the prospect of a fight, is
hurling himself upon the Romans
with shouts of ‘Leave them to me! He
is followed by Asterix, Vitalstatistix,
and the rest of the villagers, all ready
and willing to thump the enemy. The
battle, as usual, is short and sharp,
and in the bottom picture you see the
final result: weapons twisted out of
shape, and Romans _ tastefully
scattered around the battlefield. If we
come closer, they can be heard
exchanging bitter comments such as:
‘Another defeat! Told you so!
‘Those Gauls just aren’t human!”
‘You've got a point, Ordinary

mortals could never resist the might of
the Roman army! They must be gods!"

‘And it’s a fat lot of use fighting
gods!"

‘Tell you what...I'm going to
Rome to tell Caesar!

No sooner said than done, Collect-
ing his belongings, the centurion sets
off for Rome, where he meets Julius
Caesar himself. Like the good soldier
he is, pluck to the backbone, he makes
his report. It cannot be said that this
raises the Roman dictator’s spirits to
heights of delirious joy. The fact is,
Caesar 1s fed to the back teeth with the
little Gaulish village, its inhabitants
and their magic potion. He summons
his chief counsellors immediately.

--- Page 5 ---
The first counsellor sums up the
situation very neatly: “Suppose they
really are gods, O Caesar, we're ina bit
of a fix. Take an example... the
demi-god Hercules. Anyone fancy a
fight with Hercules”

However, Caesar fails to appreciate
this accurate definition of the
problem, and starts roaring, ‘1,
Caesar, will show you that those half-
wit Gauls are mere mortals! | shall go
and see them! I shall set them certain
tasks which only gods could
perform ...if they really are gods,
and they perform my tasks success-
fully, Pll admit defeat. But if they are
only men, they will feel the full force of
Caesar’s anger!

--- Page 6 ---
And soon afterwards (as we usually
say in the Asterix books, though in
this case, taking into account the
transport of the time, it must have
been about a month later) we meet
Caesar once again, engaged in conver-
sation with Vitalstatistix outside the
village gates. Thanks to a_ tape.
recorder cunningly concealed in an
amphora, we have been able to
preserve the gist of this historic con-
versation, which was to lead to the
most famous bet ever made in the
ancient world.

Caesar: | have come to make you a
proposition, O Gauls! Your defiance
of me is bad for my reputation. Back
in Rome, people are beginning to
laugh at me! Some of them say you
must be gods. If that’s so, it would
explain your superhuman strength;
it’s no use trying to fight gods. So if
you can prove that you're gods, | will
admit defeat and lay down my arms.
Vitalstatistix: And just how do you
want me and my mates to prove we're
gods, Julius?

Caesar: Ever heard of Hercules?
Vitalstatistix: Hercules Plus, the
amphora seller?

Caesar: No, no! Hercules the demi-
god! He performed twelve tasks so
successfully that the gods recognized
him as one of themselves and admitted
him to Olympus .. .
Vitalstatistix: What tasks?

--- Page 7 ---
To help him answer this question,
Caesar produces a piece of parchment
(reproduced here, below left) and sets
about improving  Vitalstatistix’s
classical education,

Caesar; Hercules... yes, Hercules
strangled the Nemean lion; killed the
Lernean hydra; caught the Eryman-
thian boar alive; hunted down the stag
with the brazen feet; shot the Stym-
phalian birds; tamed the bull sent by
Neptune to plague Minos, king of
Crete, killed Diomedes, king of
Thrace; conquered the Amazons;
cleansed the Augean stables; killed
Geryon; stole the golden apples from
the Garden of the Hesperides; and
freed Theseus from the  under-
world...

Obelix, who has kept his mouth
shut so far, now asks, ‘Right, so what's
the second task?”

While Caesar is recovering, Vital-
statistix gets his own question in. ‘You
mean you want us to do all these daft
things, just to prove we're gods?
Caesar: Notexactly ... all that’sa bit
out of date now. With the help of my
counsellors, | have drawn up a new set
of tasks for you... if you refuse to
try them, it proves you're only a bunch
of crazy half-wits!

Stung to the quick (‘We are not a
bunch of half-wits!’) the Gauls agree
to accept Caesar's challenge. Caesar
introduces them to Caius Tiddlus,
who is to act as referee.

--- Page 8 ---
When the summit conference has
ended with a dignified Roman ‘Ave!’
and an informal Gaulish ‘So long?’,
and Julius Caesar has started back to

Rome, our friends assemble in the
chiefs hut to discuss things.

Vitalstatistix, who has had time to
cast his eye over the list of tasks, has
lost some of his enthusiasm.

‘Hmm... old Julius has really got
it in for us! Look at these tasks!

‘I'm always telling you!’ interrupts
Getafix. ‘You get so carried away, and
you don't stop to think till later...”

‘Still, we couldn't let him call us a
bunch of half-wits, could we?

‘Well, no... no, Obelix... how-
ever

At this point, proving himself a true
leader of men, Vitalstatistix makes the
necessary decision:

‘Asterix, you're the cleverest of us,
and Obelix is the strongest. You're the
two most likely to succeed. We'll all
meet in Rome to accept Caesar's
surrender!’

Getafix the druid, still rather
worried by his friends’ enthusiasm and
optimism, hands Asterix a gourd full
of magic potion.

Now comes the moving scene,
manly and affecting at the same time,
in which we see the two heroes leave
the village, to the cheers of the people.
However, Obelix seems to have
something on his mind... he ts
looking for a face in the crowd.
Obelix: Notice anything, Asterix?
Asterix: Notice what?

Obelix: Don’t you think it’s funny
Cacofonix hasn't turned up to give us
a farewell song?

--- Page 9 ---
In fact, Cacofonix had every intention
of singing in honour of our heroes’
departure, but unfortunately an
extremely powerful fist came between
this idea and its execution. At this
point in our story, we must ask you to
imagine the picture (one of the lost
treasures of antiquity) of the bard, his
lyre around his neck, being hammered
into the ground by a fellow villager
with a chronic aversion to the beauties
of Gaulish folksong...

But here comes Caius Tiddlus, in
his usual sprightly manner. He unrolls
the scroll bearing the list of tasks.
‘Right, now for the first task!” he says,
in a faint voice. ‘Follow me, please.’
Then he leads our friends towards the
forest.

Here we meet a curious character,
obviously a Greek, crouched motion-
less in the posture of a sprinter on his
starting-blocks, ready to take off.
‘This is Asbestos, just back from
Marathon,’ explains Tiddlus. ‘He beat
all comers at the Olympic Games. He
can run faster than a horse, faster than
the storm wind howling through the
trees. One of you has to beat him ina
race,”

‘You do it, Asterix. You're faster
than me,’ admits Obelix, with
admirable objectivity. ‘You're faster
than the hoarse wind howling through
the trees...’


--- Page 10 ---
And with these stirring words, Obelix
and Tiddlus walk off.‘ We'll be waiting
for you the other side of the forest, on
the finishing line. You start when all
the sand has run out of this hourglass.’

Asterix is left alone with Asbestos,
the marathon runner, still motionless
on his marks. As he waits for the sand
to run out of the hourglass and give
the signal to start, Asterix tries to
strike up a conversation with his
opponent.

‘Fancy that...a real Olympic
champion! Very interesting. You
know, we have athletics in our village
too, but of course it isn’t very exciting
because we all have magic potion to
drink... hey, are you listening to

me? You aren’t? Oh, well... .1 was
saying it’s not very exciting because
we all finish at the same time, so we
have to draw lots for the winner. You
notice that I don’t need any magic
potion before a race; ve always been
a very fast runner and 1... Hey!
Where are you going? Wait for me,
can’t you?

Abestos pays no attention
whatever. The sand has all run out,
and he has started running. He isa real
streak of lightning! The birds who
watch him pass by get their feathers
ruffled.

At this point Asterix produces his
gourd of magic potion and takes a
swig...

--- Page 11 ---
... the results of which may be seen
on this page, centre left. They might be
described as impressive. Asbestos is
impressed, for one. Flying through the
air like a bullet, he is much surprised
When he suddenly hears Asterix
saying, ‘Not a bad start, old fellow!
You nearly took me by surprise! The
fact is, | forgot to watch the hourglass
while we were chatting, and...’

At this, Asbestos puts ona spurt. A

couple of detonations ring
out... Asbestos has broken the
sound barrier! As for Aster-
ix... Well, Asterix disappears for a

moment, and then we see him abreast
of Asbestos again. By this time
Asbestos has completely lost his cool.

‘I got a bit held up back there,’ says

Asterix, apologetically. ‘Il stopped to
pick some mushrooms...1 like
picking flowers too...’

At about this moment a resounding
crash is heard. Asbestos has just
collided with a tree. His nose swells up
enormously. On the other side of the
forest, Tiddlus is waving a flag, and
Asterix, holding Asbestos by the hand
like the gentleman he is, crosses the
finishing line first . . . the winner!

‘Funny thing, says Obelix, ‘he
seems to have improved his Grecian
profile! He has a nice Gaulish nose
now...

Phlegmatic as ever, Tiddlus makes
a mark on the list of tasks: ‘First task
successfully performed! Next...’

--- Page 12 ---

“YOUR SECOND
TASK IS TO THROW
THE JAVELIN FARTHER
THAN VERSES THE
PERSIAN."

Leaving Asbestos (who is now being
overtaken by a tortoise), Tiddlus,
Asterix and Obelix meet a man
waiting for them in the middle of a
large plain. He is a curious-looking
person. He wears a pointed cap and
sports a curly beard, but his most
striking feature is the development of
his right arm and shoulder, which are
much, much larger than his left arm
and shoulder. Two javelins are
planted in the ground beside him.
Tiddlus performs the introductions in
his polite, precise and neutral voice.
‘This is Verses the Persian, the most
amazing javelin thrower the world has
ever known. Your second task is to
throw the javelin farther than Verses.’

--- Page 13 ---
Without sparing our friends a glance,
Verses picks up one of the javelins ata
sign from Tiddlus. Obelix can hardly
tear his eyes away from their
opponent’s right arm and shoulder.
‘Hey, Asterix, do you think that arm
and shoulder look good? Personally, |
wouldn’t fancy it. I think it looks
better to be nicely covered all over,
like me... more symmetrical... *

While Obelix is talking, Verses has
been taking his run-up, and he throws
the javelin with amazing force.
Asterix and Obelix do their best to
follow its flight, but it disappears into
the heavens at tremendous speed.
Verses. very pleased with himself,
roars with laughter.

Up above, the javelin speeds on its
way, over lands and seas as yet undis-
covered before it starts to slow down.
And here it is, coming to earth. Sad to
relate, there is someone underneath. A
strange someone, too, his head
covered with feathers, taking a nap
outside his house. With a piercing
whistle, the javelin lands right in front
of him. Instantly, the Strange person
leaps up, waving a hatchet and
shouting, ‘War! Our enemies have
declared war!" (To be perfectly
accurate, the hatchet is a tomahawk,
the house is a tipi and the strange
person himself is a Red Indian, but
Christopher Columbus will be coming
along later to explain all that.)

--- Page 14 ---
Verses the Persian, sure he has won, is
just offering our friends the second
javelin
‘Let me have a go, Asterix!”
‘All right, Obelix. But mind you
throw it as hard as you can!’
‘Just you watch!
Obelix has seized the javelin, and
under the scornful eyes of Verses, who
thinks poorly of the length of his run-
up, he throws it. A second or so later
the javelin disappears into the clouds.
Asterix, Obelix and Verses stand there
trying to watch its flight. Suddenly
Asterix turns round, shouting, ‘Watch
out! Verses turns too ... and lets out
a great yell of terror. Obelix’s throw
has sent the javelin all the way round
the world, and here it comes back
again, making straight for Verses,
Verses starts to run, but though
Obelix seemed to be putting so little
effort into it he threw the javelin with
such force that Verses has to run a
long, long time to get away, A very
long time indeed .. . so long that he e
and the javelin end up in the camp
where the Indians, much upset by the
arrival of the first javelin, are in the
middle of a fierce fight. They stop
fighting for a moment to watch Verses
pass, still with the javelin after him.
Meanwhile, Tiddlus is leading our
friends on again.

--- Page 15 ---

--- Page 16 ---
"NOW YOU MUST FACE
CYLINDRIC THE GERMAN!
NO WRESTLER OR
GLADIATOR HAS EVER
BEATEN HIM YET."

--- Page 17 ---
We now find our friends inside a great
stadium. Pointing out a pair of
massive gates at one end, Tiddlus
explains, ‘Now you are going to face
Cylindric the German. He will come in
through those gates.”

‘See the size of them, Obelix? This
Cylindric the German must be big!

‘Huh! I like them best big. . . big
and strong!

A gong sounds, the two enormous
gates begin to open... tension is
mounting! And into the arena walksa
jolly little man wearing a judo outfit,
with a black belt round his neat little
paunch.

‘Is thar Cylindric the German?
exclaims Asterix.

‘Leave him to me, Asterix! I'll finish
him off quickly, and then we can go on
to the next task.

‘All right, but watch out... there oy
must be a catch in it somewhere. i? ie
Those are funny clothes he’s
wearing...

‘Oh, the robe doesn’t make the
druid! Watch this!” 

And Obelix marches with determi-
nation towards the mat in the centre of
the stadium. The cheerful little
German bows to him.

‘Ach... zer fat chentleman first,
ja?'

‘I AM NOT FAT?'

Obelix lunges furiously. With a single 
movement, the German takes
his arm and lifts him into the air. 

Then, without letting go, and iid —e,
swinging Obelix’s huge body intheair Fw
above his head, he beats the mat with
him.


--- Page 18 ---
Asterix comes up and starts talking to

Cylindric, who is. still thumping
Obelix up and down on the mat with
gusto.

Asterix (admiringly): I say, what a
splendid way to fight! I've never seen
anything like it.

Cylindric (pleased, but modest): Ach,
ja! I haf it vhen on my travels learnt.
Long, long travels, far away. You like
to haf a go, ja?

Asterix (eagerly): Oo, yes!

The German finishes wiping the
floor with Obelix, stands facing
Asterix, and starts the lesson:

‘Is easy! You haf only to use zer
man’s own strength to get him down!
Zer stronger he is, zer better for you,’

‘Easy... you're only saying that
because you're so strong!”

‘Nein, nein! Vord of honour! Try!
Here, you take mine hand... you
put your foot zere... gif a heave
backwards..."

Cylindric moves towards Asterix,
who grabs the German's arm and
starts wiping the floor with him in his
turn.

‘Like this?

‘Ja! Ja! Ver gut! You get ze idea!
Harder! Faster!’ And Asterix, a
willing pupil, does as he is told, before
the dazed eyes of Obelix, who is

watching the scene with interest,
though still in a state of some
confusion,


--- Page 19 ---
‘Gut! Zer next ding, vhen you haf me
down on zer ground, you take
advantage zat I am giddy and so you
jump on me! Ja! Gut! Ver’, ver’ gut!
Ja! Now you jump me on zer
stomach!

‘Like this?”

‘Ja! Gut! You take hold mine arm,
like zis, zen you pull .. . now zer legs

too... wunderbar! And so you see, |
can’t move at all...vhy, you
hay...”

Here Cylindric the German stops
short. He is not half so cheerful now!
He has just realized that Asterix has
tricked him; his voice dies away as he
finishes, ‘You haf... you haf beaten
me!’

At the same moment, up in the
spectators’ seats, the imperturbable
Tiddlus crosses another task off his
list.

In Rome, however, the atmosphere
is stormy, for Caesar has just heard

the results of the first tests.

‘Not that it proves anything.
They've not had much to cope with so
far, but now... now... they will
have to tackle the priestesses of the
Isle of Pleasure!’

And we had better move out of
range, for at this point Caesar bursts
into fearsome, hysterical laughter.
Nor are we the only ones to retreat
instictively; look at the poor counsel-
lors at the far end of the table!

--- Page 20 ---
With Caesar's laughter still ringing in
our ears, we rejoin Asterix, Obelix
and Tiddlus on the banks of a lake
with a little island in the middle of it.

Pointing to the water, Tiddlus
explains, ‘You have to cross this lake.
lil wait for you on the other side. But
in my opinion- and this is the first
time I’ve offered it— you'll never make
it across that lake! There’s a boat over
there. Well, goodbye.’

And off goes Tiddlus, leaving our
two friends alone. They soon get on
board the boat and start to row.

‘Hey, Asterix, this task is dead easy!
We'll reach the other side in no time!"

‘We'd better be careful, though,
Obelix .. . you never can tell.’

And here a melodious and tuneful
song interrupts the two Gauls. The
singing comes from the little island in
the middle of the lake. By common
and unspoken consent, and rowing
with a precision that would do credit
to a Boat Race crew, our two friends
put on an incredible turn of speed.
When they land (very noisily) they are
welcomed by a group of beautiful
young girls. The island itself is
enchanting: there are flowers every-
where, animals making music, and
butterflies flitting about in time to the

tunes. One of the girls, in that dulcet
voice adopted at a later date by the

ladies at the information desks of

airports, addresses the Gauls.
‘Welcome to the Isle of Pleasure
... the island you will never leave!
You will stay here for ever. We were
expecting you... kindly come this
way...’

And now an unforgettable experi-
ence begins for Asterix and Obelix,
While some of the young ladies scatter

flowers over them, others dance for
their entertainment (they do a very
good samba!) while others again pour
them drinks. It is like Paradise (sorry,
Olympus!) At a certain moment, one
of the girls— she happens to be the
Chief Priestess— comes up to Obelix,
all tender, loving affection. Giving
him a kiss, she asks, ‘And now, bold
warrior, what would you like?”

‘A boar to eat, says Obelix
hopefully.

--- Page 21 ---

--- Page 22 ---

“You're here on the Isle of Pleasure,
the Chief Priestess asks you what
you'd like . . . and you ask for food?

‘Why not? Eating’s a pleasure, isn’t
it?”

‘All right,’ she snaps. “We can offer
nectar and ambrosia.’

‘Nectar and .. . ? No fear! None of
that boring old stuff! | want a nice
wild boar!’

‘But there aren't any boars on this
island!

‘What...no boars, and you
expect me to stay on this island of
yours for ever? I ask you! That’s a bit
much, it really is!

Naturally, the other girls join in the
conversation, voices rising — stri-
dently...

‘Push off, fatty! You think I'd lower
myself to do your cooking?

‘Why not the washing-up too?

‘And the housework?
‘And fetch your slippers” 
The mere recital of all these horrors

is too much for the Chief Priestess.
Pointing to the lake, she yells, ‘Push
off! Get out!

No further invitation is needed.
Obelix marches furiously off towards
the bank. ‘You bet your life I'm
pushing off, by Toutatis! Not a wild
boar in sight, and they have the nerve
to call this the Isle of Pleasure! Huh!

But Asterix, his nose buried in a
flower and his eyes riveted toa vision
of well-rounded delight, has not heard
a word of Obelix’s outburst.    

--- Page 23 ---
As he passes Asterix, Obelix shouts,
‘Come on, Asterix! Get a move on!
This is a rotten café!’ And he dives into
the lake.

Asterix, who somehow does not
seem quite his usual self, turns

towards the spot where Obelix has just
disappeared. He takes a faltering step
that way, but the Chief Priestess,
recovering her nice manners and her
dulcet voice, sidles up to him, cooing
invitingly, ‘Let him go. . . stay with
us! We will give you pleasure such as
the gods themselves enjoy... *

By now the suspense is killing us!
Will Asterix succumb? We are all
holding our breath... until a loud
and very cross voice is heard. “Asterix!
It is Obelix. And Asterix, awakened
from his dream at last, jumps into the

lake too. He must be in a rather
curious condition, since as he enters
the water it hisses anda cloud of steam
rises, as if something very hot had
been plunged into it.

After a pleasantly refreshing little
swim, we find our friends back with
Tiddlus, who crosses out yet another
task on the list with his stylus. Then he
jerks his thumb at a little temple built
in the Egyptian style.

‘And now you have to look deep
into the dreadful eyes of Iris, the great
Egyptian magician...’


--- Page 24 ---
Our two friends enter the temple, to
find themselves in a large hall which is
obviously a waiting room. A little man
is already sitting there, reading
magazines. From the room next door
comes an impressive voice: “By Osiris

_and by Apis. look at me, look into my
eyes... You have turned into a
cat... yes, a cat!’ There is a brief
silence, the door opens, and out comes
a curious character on all fours.
Before leaving the temple he rubs
against the legs of the little man who is
waiting, and mews.

‘Next, please!’

The little man gets up and goes into
the magician’s room.

Soon we hear the voice of Iris again.
‘By Osiris and by Apis, look into my
eyes! By Osiris and by Apis, you have
turned into a bird... yes, a bird!

Again there is a sinister little silence,
then the door slowly opens and the |
little man comes out, fluttering
around the room. Then he takes off in
a long, soaring flight. . .

Obelix, a little worried, notices
something odd. ‘See that, Asterix? He
was flying low. That means we'll have
rain, and...’ But the harsh voice of
Iris calls, ‘Next, please!’ It is the Gauls’
turn now. Seeing them come in, Iris
raises hiseyes."What’s all this? Oh yes,

Iremember now .. . two Gauls. I was
expecting you! You... the little
one... sit there, please.” And Iris

makes Asterix sit opposite him. His
eyes light up like a couple of light-
houses. They are dazzling. ‘By Osiris
and by Apis, look at me. . .*

But Asterix interrupts. Much
impressed, he inquires, ‘I say, how do
you do that with your eyes?

‘Shut up, Gaul!’


--- Page 25 ---
| Iris’s voice is terrible, his eyes are a
dreadful sight, but Asterix, like any
good Gaul, wants to know how the

| trick is done. He persists. ‘Can you
light them up one at a time?

‘Silence! ’'m concentrating!
Er. . . where was I? Oh yes! By Osiris
and by Apis, you have turned into a
boar...

‘It must be useful for reading in
bed.”

“You are... you are.

‘I'm a boar...’

‘That's it! I'm a boar! By Opis and
Asiris, I'm a boar...! And so
on... until the moment when Iris,
unable to bear it, dashes out of the
temple, grunting ferociously...

--- Page 26 ---
Leaving Iris, who now thinks he is a
boar, to his own devices, along with
the man who thinks he is a cat and the
man who thinks he is a bird, Asterix
and Obelix rejoin Tiddlus, who leads
them to an inn. ‘Your next task will be
to eat every morsel of the meal
prepared for you by Calorifix, the

great chef of the Titans. No mortal
man has ever been able to get through
one of his enormous meals, but you
will have to eat it all, down to the very
last crumb. Enjoy yourselves!’

‘An interesting kind of task at

last... ! Yes, quite right: that was
Obelix, marching into the inn,

rubbing his hands. He is welcomed by
the famous chef Calorifix, in his inter-
esting foreign accent.

‘Alors, you are expected, monsieur!
| bring in ze banquet right away!" As
Obelix sits down and tucks a napkin
under his chin, Calorifix disappears
into the kitchens. He is soon back,
carrying an enormous roast boar sur-
rounded by chips. ‘What's this?’ asks
Obelix, pointing to a chip. ‘Ah, zees |

‘ave invent myself. Ees shape like ze

cheeps of wood, but grow in ze
ground. | ‘ave not yet found ze good
name, but I think it be ze big success,
no?

Obelix gets to work on the boar,
which is soon looking pretty silly.
Never mind, Calorifix is back already
with another dish...

There is a swing-door into the
kitchen, and every time it swings open
Calorifix comes back with more to

eat. He praises his creations in lyrical
terms. ‘Ze ox! Ees good, ze ox! Ze
geese! Geese ees good, zey are fat! Ze
nice flock of muttons... [ope you
like. Ze ole school of fish! Ze cow and
ze veals ... ees not right to separate
ze family! Ze great Titanic ome-
lette .. . eight dozen eggs! Ze camel!
Zis you will like. Eet ‘ave ze good
stuffing too.” And so the banquet goes
on, to the sound of an impressive

Obelix.

Meanwhile, it is getting dark
outside, but Asterix does nat seem to
be worrled...and in the end
Calorifix stumbles out of the inn door.
very upset indeed. ‘Did he eat the lot’?
asks Tiddlus. This is just too much for
the unhappy chef, who bursts into
tears. ‘Yes! Yes! I’ave nozzing left in
ze kitchen. Nozzing! As Calorifix
disappears, Obelix emerges...a
slightly disappointed Obelix, asking,
‘Did anyone see which way that chef
went? He let me down when I'd only
had a few starters!

Leaving Calorifix to nurse his
sorrows, our friends and Tiddlus now
make for a cave in the mountainside.

--- Page 28 ---

Soon they find themselves at the cave
entrance, It is shaped like a monstrous
mouth, and Tiddlus explains their
next task, “You must go into the Cave
of the Beast.’

‘Beast? What Beast’ asks Asterix,
‘And what is this Beast like?”

‘T've no idea. No one has ever come
out alive ...* And with these words,
Tiddlus leaves them.

Inside the cave it is pitch dark, but
noisy. We hear sinister laughter, and
the screeching of horrible birds flying
low as they pass. This reminds Obelix
of something. ‘Hey, Asterix...’

“Yes, | know; they're flying low, we
shall have rain.”

--- Page 29 ---
‘Well, if they think they can frighten us
they’re wrong, because everyone
knows we fear only one thing, the sky
falling on our heads, and...’

‘Watch out, Obelix! For, with a
terrifying roar, a nightmare device has
nearly run our two friends down.

‘What was that, Asterix?

‘I’ve no idea, but I'm beginning to
get fed up. | wonder what the time

‘Twelve noon. 1 could do with
feeding up too.

‘Don’t say you feel hungry again!

‘I always feel hungry at twelve
noon! I could eat anything .. . any-
thing at all! And at these forceful
words a tremendous row breaks out,
followed by a very confused free-for-
all...we next find Asterix and
Obelix emerging through the manhole
cover of the Cave of the Beast, and
back with Tiddlus again on the terrace
of an inn.

‘Forgive my curiosity, but what mas
the Beast like?” asks Tiddlus.

‘Very tasty!’ replies Obelix happily,
giving the waiter his order. ‘I'd like a
drink to wash it down!

--- Page 30 ---
The inn where our friends are sitting
looks out on a street full of very
peculiar characters. All the passers-by
seem very agitated. We hear raucous
laughter, we see eyes swivelling round
and round, we see people walking on
their hands. A woman comes running
past, waving her arms about and
clucking like a frightened hen. She is
pursued by a_ suspicious-looking
character brandishing an enormous
hatchet and licking his lips. The

couple pass a personage of obvious
importance, having a bath in a tub
carried by four slaves, but they take no
notice of him. Finally, despite his
equable nature, Asterix can no longer
conceal his surprise.

‘Oh,’ says Tiddlus, ‘these people
have all been in the place that sends
you mad.’

‘Place that sends you mad?

“Yes, and you have to go there too;
that’s your next task.’ And Tiddlus

points out a vast building nearby.

“What do we have to do in there?

‘Nothing much, You have to get
hold of a certain permit which allows
you to go on to the next task."

‘I see. Just a simple administrative
formality?

‘That’s right . . . an administrative
formality. Ask for Permit A38.’

‘Well, off we go, Obelix.’

No sooner said than done. Our
friends enter the building.


--- Page 31 ---
“What is it? the desk clerk asks, ungra-~
ciously.

‘We want a Permit Number A38.’

The desk clerk cups his hand
around his ear. ‘Want to register a
galley? They've sent you to the wrong
place. You want the harbourmaster’s
office, down by the port.’

‘What? And realizing, like our-
selves, that the desk clerk is deaf as a
post, Asterix goes on patiently, ‘No.
We do not want to register a galley.
We want Permit Number A38.’

‘The port? It’s the other end oftown,
by the seaside, you can’t miss it...’

‘But we don’t want to go to the port!
We want Permit A38!"

‘What?

‘PERMIT A38!

“There’s no need to shout! What
manners! Where do you think you are,
by Jupiter? Apply at Window number
one, left-hand corridor, last door on
the right.’

Our friends follow his instructions,
only to find that there is no door atall
on the right in the left-hand corridor.
‘Let’s try the door opposite,’ suggests
Asterix. They walk into a small, bare
room. A large civil servant is sitting on
a swing in the middle of the room,
while a pretty girl pushes him. At the
sight of his visitors, the civil servant
stops swinging. He is furious.

‘Who said you could come in?

‘Er... we want Window one.’

‘Then consult the floor plan up on
the sixth floor .,.°

--- Page 32 ---

--- Page 33 ---
On the sixth floor, they find that the
proper place to go is Window two.
Here two clerical workers are engaged
in animated conversation. “You know
her ... and mind you, she can’t even
afford to keep a slave...’

‘Please, miss... * (Asterix, trying
to attract the lady’s attention.)

‘She sold off her Iberian, claiming
she preferred to do her own
housework, but...’

‘Please, miss! (Asterix again. He is
getting annoyed. )

‘Can't you see I'm busy? Now,
where was 1? Oh, yes! Poor old
Claudius! You know, he...’

‘PLEASE, MISS! (Asterix’s irrita-
tion is increasing visibly.)

‘Oh, by Jupiter! How rude people

are these days! Well, what do you
want?
‘Permit A38.
‘Have you filled in the blue form?
‘Blue form? No.’
‘Then how do you think you're
going to get Permit A387
‘So where do I get the blue form?
‘Window one. Now, where was
And it is the same story as the Gauls

make their way all round the
building .. .

‘The blue form? No, not here. Try
Window seven, fifth floor...’

‘The green form... Window
fourteen...’

Mingling with the babble of voices,
we hear such remarks as: ‘I told you,

the port is by the seaside!’ ‘Can't you
see I’m busy’ and finally a voice roars
out, ‘STOP IT! Obelix’s nerves have
cracked up under the strain. ‘Asterix,
we'll never get out of here... the
magic potion won't be any use in this
place! We shall go mad, and end upas
Caesar's slaves!"

‘Not if | know it. ] have an idea!
We'll fight them with their own
weapons. Watch this!’

And Asterix starts going round
asking for Permit Number A39 ‘as
stipulated in the new circular B65’,
which of course exists only in his own
fertile imagination. The trick comes
off! Soon the building is in a state of
ferment, as everyone searches for this
mysterious new document. The
tumult is at its height in the entrance
hall, where only the Prefect seems to
be keeping his cool. Seeing this,
Asterix decides to strike while the iron
is hot. ‘Please, sir...’

‘lm very busy just now! What do
you want?

‘Permit A38?

The Prefect produces a small slab
from the folds of his toga and, in some
annoyance, hands it to Asterix. ‘Here
you are! Now kindly get out. Some
people here are trying to work!

And as Asterix and Obelix leave the
building, we hear the Prefect give a
great peal of demented laughter.

--- Page 34 ---
AND HERE YOU DO
NOT SEE THE INVISIBLE
WIRE OVER WHICH
YOU MUST CROSS
THIS ABYSS.

With these words, Tiddlus informs
our friends of the nature of their next
task. Obelix has a bright idea. ‘Why
don’t we cross the abyss down below,
instead of walking over the wire? I can
see a little river, but the water looks
calm...°

‘Ah, yes, but in fact that little river is
full of crocodiles ...very sacred
crocodiles, given to Caesar by Queen
Cleopatra of Egypt. And they are
very, very savage!”

‘Yuk! I don’t like crocodiles. I tried
them once...they were stringy.
Come on, Asterix!’

Asterix complies, and the two of
them set off across the abyss. But it is
not easy to master tightrope walking
at the first attempt!


--- Page 35 ---
They proceed, contorting their bodies,
arms outstretched; the wire sags
beneath them, and our friends indulge
in all sorts of acrobatics before they
finally fall. Asterix grabs hold of the
wire and Obelix grabs
Asterix’s legs. They stay like that fora
moment; then we hear a deep sigh and
see them glance into space.

‘Oh, well, says Obelix, ‘I suppose
we'll have to. Coming, Asterix?

‘Wait a moment...’ Asterix lets
go of the wire with one hand, takes out
his gourd of magic potion and has a
swig. Thunder and lightning...

‘Here goes!’ He lets go with his
other hand, and they both fall. It is a
long, long time before we hear two

hold of

splashes as our friends hit the water.
Next we hear sounds of fighting,
fearsome grunts, the wild churning of
the water, and above all the noise,
Obelix’s voice shouting, ‘Filthy
creatures! Nasty inedible things!
Then we see the crocodiles rising from
below, looking absolutely dazed, and
flying off in all directions. Reliable
witnesses claim to have seen suitcases,
wallets and shoes, all labelled
‘Genuine Crocodile’, going the same
way, and there must be some truth in
this story . . . at least, something par-
ticularly nasty must be going on down
in the abyss, since the crocodiles
prefer to stay clinging to the wire
rather than go down again.


--- Page 36 ---
All the two Gauls have to do now is
rejoin Tiddlus, who has been fishing
as he waits for them on the edge of the
abyss.

‘And now you must climb the
highest mountain in these parts. At
the top you will find the Old Man of
the Mountains, who will ask you a
riddle.’

‘Couldn't this old man come down
here to ask us his riddle?

‘Come on, Obelix, don’t be lazy! Off
we go!

And our friends start climbing. The
going gets harder and harder, until the
rockface is almost vertical. There is
wind and snow. Eagles fly past close to
the climbers, but Obelix just brushes
them away as if they were bothersome
insects. Finally the moment comes
when Obelix reaches up again for the
next hand-hold, and fails to find one.
‘Hey, Asterix, I’ve run out of
mountain...”

They meet a man there, an old, old
man, his voice the croaking voice of
extreme age.

‘! am the Old Man of the
Mountains. Have you miserable
mortals come for my riddle?

‘Yes... hurry up and ask it, Old
Man of the Mountains! It’s not very
warm up here, by Toutatis!’

‘Do you know, foolish men, that if
you fail to give the right answer you
will be plunged instantly into the
depths of Hell?

“What, after climbing all this way?
Obelix is indignant. ‘I call that a bit
steep!’

--- Page 37 ---

--- Page 38 ---
‘O presumptuous mortals... one of
you, eyes blindfolded, must tell me
which of these two piles of laundry
was washed in Olympus, the divine
detergent!”

Asterix volunteers for the task. A
few seconds later, he points to one of
the piles. ‘This one!

‘Yes!’ The Old Man's voice is
younger, stronger! He is holding up a
detergent packet. ‘You got it right!
You recognized Olympus! The gods
themselves do their washing with
Olympus, which washes whiter and
leaves your hands so, so soft! O ye
gods, did you hear that? This mortal
gave the right answer!’

The gods have heard all right, and
in the course of a short visit to Mount
Olympus we discover that the way
people who would like to be gods too
keep getting the riddle right is
beginning to annoy them a good
deal .. . so much, in fact, that Jupiter
lets loose a violent thunderstorm!

Meanwhile, Asterix and Obelix
have gone back down to the plain at
the foot of the mountain. Tiddlus tells
them they will have to spend the night
there. “Good idea, says Asterix. ‘I'm
rather tired.

However, while our friends are
sleeping soundly, some — strange
Roman legionaries appear on the
scene. Obelix, woken by the noise they
make, rubs his hands in glee. ‘Goody!
Romans, all for me!’ And he makes
for them. But much to his surprise, his
fists meet thin air. This ts too much for
Obelix. The phantom legionaries roar
with mocking laughter. “Don’t bother
your head, poor mortal! We are

ghosts ...departed spirits who
haunt this place. All who venture to
spend the night here die of

fear... ha, ha, ha!

‘What's all this row in aid of? A
furious interruption from Asterix.
‘Do you know what the time is?
Obelix tries to explain that the ghosts
are only trying to keep their poor
departed spirits up, but Asterix is not |
impressed. ‘We've run a big race,
we've tackled priestesses, magicians.
chefs, civil servants, crocodiles, and
we need our beauty sleep! You can
keep your spirits up, but don't keep us
up! Push off?

--- Page 39 ---

--- Page 40 ---
Asterix sounds so fierce that the poor
ghosts, feeling demoralized and mis-
understood, decide to go back to the
underworld.

Next morning we find the two
Gauls waking up, much to their
surprise, in front of a vast flight of
steps to a palace guarded by legiona-
ries who are far from ghostly.

‘Where are we? asks Asterix.

‘You're in Rome, outside Julius
Caesar's palace. Caesar is expecting
you.

‘Either there’s something funny
going on around here, Asterix,’ says
Obelix, ‘or the Romans have learnt to
build very fast...”

‘Oh, what does it matter? Come on,
soldier, take us to your leader!


--- Page 41 ---
Asterix and Obelix are ushered into
the presence of Caesar. Tiddlus is

there too, complete with his list of

tasks, his imperturbability, and his
precise little voice, which announces,
‘O Caesar, they have performed all the
tasks, overcome every problem, and
succeeded every time...’

‘Well, Gauls, it cannot be denied
that the gods have favoured
you... but this is where your luck
runs out! Your last task takes place in
the Circus here in Rome, where you

will be slaughtered along with all the
other people from your village.
They’re waiting for you ther..."

‘Oh, good! They came!’

‘You will all be killed for the
amusement of my people, and my
triumph will be complete at last! Have
you anything to add, O Gauls?”

Coming a little closer, we observe
that Asterix and Obelix, always fond
of a joke, cannot resist their usual
comment: ‘These Romans are crazy!’

We need hardly add that this gets

them removed from Caesar's presence
in double quick time. As the Circus
Maximus begins to fill up with a
happy crowd, our friends are taken off
to prison, where they meet the other
Gauls from their own little village.
Everyone is delighted; there is a lot of
shouting and laughing and hugging.
Suddenly we hear thunderous
applause outside. Asterix glances out
at the arena through the barred
window. ‘Caesar has just arrived!’


--- Page 42 ---
Getafix, who has been over ina corner
stirring something in a cauldron,
announces, ‘Roll up, everyone! The
potion’s ready!” Asterix is rightly first
in the queue for a ladleful, which has
its usual spectacular effect.

Meanwhile, Caesar, in his Imperial
Box, is asking the Organizer of the
Games, ‘Well, have you carried out
my instructions?

“Yes, O Caesar. For a start, these
unhappy Gauls will have to face the

fiercest of our gladiators. And then if

there are any survivors, we let out the
wild beasts! We have lions and tigers
and panthers and _ bears, even
elephants! A lovely programme! The
audience will like it!

‘All right... sound the trumpets,
the Games are about to begin!’ Caesar
waves his hand, and the trumpets
sound, Inside the circus prison, where
everyone has now been dosed with
magic potion, the Gaulish chief Vital-
statistix, installed on his shield, claps
his hands for silence. ‘Listen,
everyone! The show is about te start! I
go in first, and you all follow me. And
keep in line, please. There are going to
be crowds of people there watching us,
so let’s show a bit of dignity, right’?

Obelix, however, does not entirely
agree with the programme. ‘And just
why do you think you should go first.
O Chief Vitalstatistix?

‘Because I av the chief, that’s why!


--- Page 43 ---
If Vitalstatistix thought that this
would clinch the argument, Obelix
instantly proves him wrong. *You may
be the chief, but we've been doing all
the work, haven't we, Asterix’?
Asterix prefers to keep quiet, but not
everyone shares his common sense
and moderation . . . least of all Fulli-
automatix, who now joins in, sending
the ball back into Obelix’s court. ‘All
the more reason for the rest of us to
have a bit of fun now! The argument
is soon in full swing, and understanda-
bly enough Unhygienix wants to have
his say too: “That's right! Some people
get all the luck!

Witnesses of this scene who gave an
account of it later all agree that it was
at this point Impedimenta, the chief's
wife, spoke up for chivalry and
tradition. ‘Nicely brought up people
let women go first!"

Everyone is shouting at once.

“Women AND children first!’

‘And how about me? sings out
Geriatrix.‘I’m the oldest inhabitant!
I've got a right to go first, haven't I?

Meanwhile, up in the Imperial Box
with the worthy Tiddlus beside him,

Julius Caesar turns to the Organizer

of the Games, who is waiting for his
orders. ‘Bring on the gladiators!

--- Page 44 ---
No sooner had Julius Caesar uttered
these words than a fanfare of trumpets
echoes through the vast Circus
Maximus. The crowd sits up straight,
and silence falls (apart from a faint
sound of shouting from the Gauls’
cells). A barred gate is raised on one
side of the arena, and in march the
gladiators, striding out in single file, to
the applause of the now deliriously
enthusiastic audience. Their calm,
their strength and discipline make an
impressive sight as they stand facing
Caesar's box. At a signal, they raise
their arms and utter their famous
greeting in chorus. ‘Ave Caesar!
Morituri te salutant!’

And now Caesar orders, ‘Force the
Gauls into the arena!’

The trumpets sound again. Another
barred gate is slowly raised on the
other side of the arena. And
then... nothing! No one comes in!
More trumpets...rather more
insistent this time. Finally the Gauls,
still preoccupied by their own quarrel,
tumble out into the arena. They are
headed by Asterix, followed by Obelix
and Getafix; the rest of the procession
is a little less orderly. Certainly the
whole thing bears little resemblance to
the entry of condemned men into an
arena where, in theory, they are about
to die!

A heated argument is still in
progress.

“Want me to smack your great fat
face, Mister Unhygienix?

‘You just try it, Mister Obelix!’

--- Page 45 ---

--- Page 46 ---
During this little exchange, some of
the gladiators have been trying to
attack the two debaters, only to be
hammered into the ground for
uninvited interference.

It very soon becomes clear that the
circus professionals are finding the
situation more than they can handle.
One of them is on the run, pursued by
Dogmatix, who obviously has designs
on his well-rounded behind. Impedi-
menta is chasing another, bashing him
over the head with a blunt instrument
which has ever afterwards occupied a
place of honour in every good house-
wife’s domestic equipment.

_While Asterix and Obelix are
having their fling, let us take a look at
the bard Cacofonix, who is standing
quite still, one arm behind his back,
beside a stunned gladiator. We may
also observe his Critic Number One,
Fulliautomatix, following his
example and stalking up to the bard,
who has just opened his mouth.
Possibly to start on a victory
ode... Fulliautomatix raises his
arm... and brings it down! But just
as it makes contact, Cacofonix slips
on a gladiator’s helmet bearing an
enormous metal crest. Howls of pain
from Fulliautomatix, howls of
laughter from those who saw this little
episode. In his box, the horror-
stricken Caesar gives Tiddlus a nasty
look. Tiddlus, calm as ever, is
enjoying an iced lolly...

--- Page 47 ---

--- Page 48 ---
A few more thumps happily distrib- |
uted about the place, and soon there is
not a single able-bodied gladiator in
sight. Vitalstatistix, who has had a few
transport problems with his shield-
bearers, now manages to have himself
brought face to face with the Imperial
Box. Ina voice like a circus clown’s, he
inquires, ‘O Caesar, we've finished off
the gladiators! What’s the next turn?”

Caesar, looking very displeased
indeed, turns to the Organizer of the
Games. ‘Wild beasts! Bring on the
wild beasts at once!’ The Organiz-
er—-who looks as though he is
beginning to wonder about his future
career— gives a signal. The trumpets
sound. But the fanfare is much less
solemn this time; it sounds more likea
circus tune than music suitable for an
execution,

Barred gates rise all around the
arena, and on come the lions, tigers,
panthers, bears and elephants.

And the wild beasts go just the same
way as the gladiators . . . if anything,
the effect is even more striking! The
animals, who may have entered the
arena a little over-confidently, are
brought to heel by our friends at once.
A tap or so, an affectionate but firm
kick here and there, and that does the
trick: the animals are tamed.

--- Page 49 ---

--- Page 50 ---
Some of the Gauls bend down so that
the tigers and panthers can leap grace-
fully over their backs. The bears dance
in a dignified manner for the young
(and pretty) wife of Geriatrix. In fact
the wild animals, instantly grasping
what the future course of history will
be, spontaneously start acting like the
tame circus animals we all know. The
elephants do their best to forma living
pyramid (Obelix has taken it into his
head to organize one). Dogmatix rides
grandly on a lion’s back. In short, the
performance is better suited to the Big
Top than the sinister and blood-
soaked Circus Maximus of Rome. In
addition, the whole thing is accom-
panied by loud circus fanfares, and the
applause and laughter of the audience.

The one place where no one feels in
the least little bit like laughing is the
Imperial Box. The Organizer of the
Games is on the verge of a nervous
breakdown. We hear him crying,
‘They've done for the circus! The
children are happy! People are
laughing! It’s a shame! Circuses will
never be the same again!

--- Page 51 ---
Caesar now turns to Tiddlus, who is
holding the list of tasks. Tiddlus looks
at Caesar. Then, still the perfect civil
servant, imperturbable as ever, he
makes one large tick on the whole
thing.

And now Julius Caesar has risen to
his feet. With a wave of his arm, he
silences the circus. Then, in a hoarse
voice, he proclaims:

‘Gauls! You have performed all the
twelve tasks lset you... soyoumust
be gods, and it’s no good trying to
fight gods! You are our masters! |
leave my fate and the fate of Rome in
your hands.”

And Caesar takes off his laurel
wreath and flings it to the ground. It
falls in the sand, right at the feet of the
Gauls, who have formed a smiling
group in the middle of the arena. The
applause is deafening. Asterix and his
friends pose for the sculptor, whose
souvenir group is going to puzzle
historians for generations to come.

--- Page 52 ---
However, one question remains to be
asked: what will the victorious Gauls
do to the man they have overcome at
the end of the twelve tasks successfully
(and so stylishly!) performed by
Asterix and Obelix?

We find the answer in a little
Roman. villa nestling among green
trees. Here is Julius Caesar, busy
digging his garden and watering his
flowers.

Yes...the magnanimous Gauls
have allowed Caesar to retire to this
little country villa, to live in peace and
quiet, far from the burdens and cares
of power...

‘Julius! Dinner’s ready!’

That was a feminine voice we heard
calling Caesar...the voice of
Cleopatra. And Caesar would no
more dream of disobeying her now
than before . . . in fact, less so, since
he has discovered hitherto unrecog-
nized talents in his fair companion, as
witness the following remark . . .

“What a wonderful cook you are,
Cleopatra dear!’

But it is time for us to leave them, if
only to find out what became of the
other characters in this story.

--- Page 53 ---
It seems a fair guess to say that Verses
must still be running around the
world, pursued by Obelix’s javelin,
Calorifix will have gone back to his
ovens, the poor scared crocodiles are
back in their river again, and the good
Old Man of the Mountains is still
plugging Olympus, the divine

detergent.
As for the place that sends you mad,
no doubt about that at all... we see

evidence around us every day to prove
that it went right back to functioning
even more crazily than before .. .

And how about Caius Tiddlus?
Calm, phlegmatic, good-natured
Tiddlus, what about him? Well, he
was allowed to choose his own reward
for his good and faithful service. And
he has decided to go into exile (!) on
the Isle of Pleasure, where we see him
in action, indulging every whim, his
famous imperturbability gone for
good.

As for our Gaulish friends, led by
Asterix and Obelix, they have gone
back to their quiet little village.

--- Page 54 ---
And all is well. Life is back to normal.
Getafix the druid is still making his
potions, and Cacofonix the bard has
suggested ‘giving them a little song’ in
honour of the villagers’ exploits ...a
suggestion which left him, as usual,
tied up at the foot of a tree.

This evening, in the little village
which is now the centre of the known
world, the conquerors, re-united
around their chief Vitalstatistix, are
getting ready to celebrate with one of
their traditional banquets.

Wait a moment, though .. . what
was that? | fancy | hear some of our
readers raising an objection...

Oh... you were saying it doesn't
seem to match up with historical fact?
The Gauls never really conquered
Julius Caesar? Fair enough... but
that’s the great thing about a strip
cartoon, you can give your imagina-
tion full rein! What’s wrong with a
little wishful thinking... ?

“Hey, Asterix, have we
become the rulers of Rome?

“Well, let's face it, Obelix... like
they were saying, this is only a strip
cartoon. Anything goes...”

‘Anything goes’?

And with these words Obelix disap-
pears from sight. Only Asterix knows
where he has gone... . ‘to an austere
island retreat where he is getting ready
for our next adventures . . . but don’t
tell anyone, it’s a secret!
